The file, sv06_to_klipper.pdf, is a running tutorial history of changing a stock Sovol SV06 printer from Marlin to open source Klipper. It describes the process, trial and trbulations of the changeover, and calibrations needed.

The file,  klipper_bed_leveling_experiments.pdf, lays out the problems of trying to achieve a level bed with the standard inductive probe of the SV06. It deals with issues where the inductive probe cannot faithfully resolve the bed surface. Potential reasons for the lack of correlation are discussed. 
The Bed_Calc.xlsm file is an Excel file that is associated with the bed leveling experiments. It contains calculation methods related to adjusting the Z tilt, and how the klipper bed mesh calibration data was manually altered to achieve good first layer prints.

The 3x3 first layer print used for first layer uniformity is included. 

A new calibration "tree" model files that are used to calibrate the x and y stepper motor settings is also included.
